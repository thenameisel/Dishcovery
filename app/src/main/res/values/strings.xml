    <string name="terms_conditions"><![CDATA[ <h2>Terms & Conditions<br>(aka The Rules of Engagement)</h2> <br><p><b>1. Existential Disclaimer:</b> This app is developed by <b>El</b>, a lone wanderer who would much rather be exploring the universe in search of the meaning of <b>16</b>. However, in a moment of questionable decision-making, they made this app instead.</p> <br><p><b>2. Snack Tax:</b> Usage of this app implies a <i>moral obligation</i> to donate snacks to El. Preferred offerings include, but are not limited to: chips, cookies, and anything with an absurd amount of cheese.</p> <br><p><b>3. Cold Brew Fund Clause:</b> El’s <b>cold brew addiction</b> is <u>not</u> a joke. If this app breaks, assume the caffeine supply has run dry.</p> <br><p><b>4. Chaos Contribution Agreement:</b> By clicking “I Agree,” you acknowledge that you are directly contributing to the <b>furtherance of chaos</b>. Whether that chaos benefits or hinders society is yet to be determined.</p> <br><p><b>5. Warranty (Or Lack Thereof):</b> This app comes with <b>zero guarantees</b> of functionality, longevity, or stability. Much like the developer’s sleep schedule.</p> <br><p><b>6. Bug Acknowledgment Pact:</b> Should you encounter a bug, you may assume it is: <ul> <li>A secret feature.</li> <li>A deliberate test of your patience.</li> <li>The result of El getting distracted by space documentaries.</li> </ul></p> <br><p><b>7. Revocation of Logic:</b> Any logical conclusions drawn from using this app are purely coincidental.</p> <br><p><b>8. Final Clause of Doom:</b> If you have read this far, congratulations. You have already exhibited <b>the level of curiosity necessary to fuel this madness.</b> Proceed at your own risk.</p> <br><p>By pressing “I Agree,” you <b>willingly and enthusiastically</b> contribute to El’s <i>quest for caffeine, chaos, and cosmic truths.</i></p> ]]></string>
